# EcoSwap – Local Barter and Exchange Platform 🌀

EcoSwap is a final-year BCA project developed to encourage sustainable living by enabling users to exchange goods without the use of money. It’s a simple, secure, and locally-deployable barter platform built using PHP and MySQL.

---

## 🚀 Project Description

EcoSwap is a web-based system designed to connect people within a local community (e.g., college, housing society) and allow them to upload, browse, and request items for exchange.

Instead of discarding unused but usable items, users can list them on the platform and swap them with others — promoting a waste-free and eco-conscious lifestyle.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Promote eco-friendly and zero-waste practices

   Or download the ZIP and extract it.

2. **📂 Move to Server Directory**

   For XAMPP, move the folder into:
   ```
   C:\xampp\htdocs\
   ```

3. **🗃️ Create the Database**

   - Open `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`
   - Create a new database (e.g., `ecoswap`)
   - Import `ecoswap.sql` if provided

4. **⚙️ Configure Database Connection**

   Edit `config.php` (or `db.php`) and update:

   ```php
   $host = 'localhost';
   $db = 'ecoswap';
   $user = 'root';
   $pass = '';
   ```

5. **📂 Create Uploads Directory**

   Inside the main project folder:

   ```bash

   Or manually:
   - Create `uploads/` folder
   - Inside it, create `products/`

   > This folder is used to store uploaded product images.

6. **👨‍💻 Add Default Admin User**

   Run this script once to add a default admin to your database:

   ```bash
   http://localhost/ecoswap/scripts/create_default_admin.php
   ```

   > Make sure the database is created before running this!
   > To access admin panel login with that email and password on login.php
